# Devin's Personal Website

## This website was a learning ground,
I wanted a space to test my more abstract ideas in design and web-development while also displaying some of my
personal projects and work. I hope it has personality and playfulness, withough sacrficing professionalism.

I'm currently refining some of the text and adding more examples of my illustrative work, as well as ironing out
some kinks for different browsers and, of course, mobile support.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
