## This website was a learning ground,
I wanted a space to test my more abstract ideas in design and web-development while also displaying some of my
personal projects and work. I hope it has personality and playfulness, without sacrficing professionalism. I'm not mouch of a graphic designer but I pushed what I could do with SVG elements and tried to balance the aesthetic, my apologies for the fonts I chose... I was young.
